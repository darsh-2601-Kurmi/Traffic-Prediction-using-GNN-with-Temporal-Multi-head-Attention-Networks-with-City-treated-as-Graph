# Traffic-Prediction-using-GNN-with-Temporal-Multi-head-Attention-Networks-with-City-treated-as-Graph
This paper presents a novel framework for short-term traffic prediction that integrates Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) with a Temporal Multi-Head Attention mechanism, using real-world city map data to construct a structurally accurate graph representation of the urban traffic network. Traditional models often fall short of capturing the complex spatiotemporal dependencies inherent in dynamic road systems. To address this, the proposed approach models road segments and intersections as graph nodes, with edges reflecting true spatial connectivity based on map topology. The GNN captures spatial relationships between connected regions, while the temporal attention module dynamically weighs historical traffic patterns across multiple time steps, focusing on the most relevant temporal features. This hybrid architecture enables more precise and interpretable traffic flow forecasting by jointly learning from both spatial context and temporal trends. Evaluated on real-world datasets, the model demonstrates improved accuracy and generalizability compared to conventional deep-learning approaches. The integration of geographic structure and temporal adaptability makes this solution well-suited for applications in intelligent transportation systems, such as traffic control, navigation, and autonomous driving. The results underscore the value of combining graph-based learning with temporal attention and map-informed structure for robust and context-aware traffic prediction.
